# Project Proposal

## Big Idea
For our project, we will create a website where students can give fedback and rate the courses that they have taken at Babson College. Our platform will let students share their opinion on many aspects of the course, including the couse content, workload, pace, professor's teaching, and overall experience. The main goal of our project is to provide a valuable resource for current and future students that will help them make a more informed decision when it comes to course registration.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. User registration?
2. Course database with basic information (course number, name and description)
3. ability for students to leave their reviews and rate for the courses. 
4. search bar to find courses. 

### Stretch goal
- Integration of ratings that will provide an overall score.
- A comment section for users to ask questions.
- The user can create a new page for a new course (if the course is not yet available).


## Learning Objectives
Our shared learning objectives are to gain experience with web develoment. We want to understand and apply different libraries to create the best experience for the users. We want to learn and implement how to link the data base that we will be providing, with each one of the feedback submitions of the students. 

#### Luna's objectives
I want to learn how to implement a database into the website and gain experience in problem solving and software design. 

#### Juanse's objectives


## Implementation Plan
We plan to investigate and use the following technologies:
- HTML for web design


## Project Schedule
Here is a general timeline for our project:
| Date | Description |
|------| ------------|
|**11/10**| Project proposal due.|
|**11/15**| Finish document about the courses that will be listed in the website. Have an idea on how we want the website to look like.|
|**11/20**| Review the coding the first look of the website.|
|**11/23**| Implement the database into the website.|
|**11/30**| Send it to some friends and classmates so that we could get feedback on what needs improvement.|
|**12/02**| Final check of the project. Make sure everything is running smoothly.|
|**12/04**| Final demo and presentation session.|
|**12/08**| Project website due.|
|**12/09**| Code submission.|

In between this dates, we will also have a *design review*, a *code review*, and a *mid-project presentation*. 

## Collaboration Plan
Communication is the most important aspect of the project. If there is no communicaiton betwween us, the project will be a total fail. 
Our plan is that one in charge of the database and the other of the page's look. Each will present their ideas to the other and will share our thoughts and opinions. 
Then, we will come together to insert the database in to the website and continue from there. 

## Risks and Limitations
One thread to our projec'ts success is that 1. we wont be able to link a database with the website, 2. that the data entered by the users won't be put automatically in the database, and 3. that because there will be so much information, the information and/or our coding will get mixed up.
