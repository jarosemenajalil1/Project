# Project Proposal

## Big Idea
For our project, we will create a website where students can give fedback and rate the courses that they have taken at Babson College. Our platform will let students share their opinion on many aspects of the course, including the couse content, workload, pace, professor's teaching, and overall experience. The main goal of our project is to provide a valuable resource for current and future students that will help them make a more informed decision when it comes to course registration.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. User registration?
2. Course database with basic information (course number, name and description)
3. ability for students to leave their reviews and rate for the courses. 
4. search bar to find courses. 

### Stretch goal
- Integration of ratings that will provide an overall score.
- A comment section for users to ask questions.
